# VBA-Challenge

i had to do this 3 times because when i sent the orginal file i didnt know that the vba script wouldnt send with it. Excel wont let you save the module so everytime i closed excel even tho the scrpt was already  written and the new cells were made the module was gone when i reopened it. extremely frustrating because this took me a long time everytime i had to redo it and then on top of that i had to do the newest challenge.
